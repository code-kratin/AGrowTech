## Description

Food security for billions of people on earth requires minimizing crop damage by timely detection of diseases.Developing methods
for detection of plant diseases serves the dual purpose of increasing crop yield and reducing pesticide use without knowing
about the proper disease. Along with development of better crop varieties, disease detection is thus paramount goal for achieving
food security. The traditional method of disease detection has been to use manual examination by either farmers or experts, which
can be time consuming and costly, proving infeasible for millions of small and medium sized farms around the world.

This project is an approach to the development of plant disease recognition model, based on leaf image classification, by the
use of deep convolutional networks. The developed model is able to recognize 38 different types of plant diseases out of of 14 different plants with the ability to distinguish plant leaves from their surroundings.
